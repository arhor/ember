# ADR Conventions (Reference)

## Directory

Ember ADRs live in `docs/architecture/decisions/`, indexed by `README.md`.
Use this path for reading, creation, bootstrap and lifecycle maintenance.

## Filename Conventions

Pattern: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`, for example `0039-choose-database.md`.
Use the next integer above the maximum existing prefix across all statuses,
starting at 0001 and zero-padding to at least four digits. Do not reuse gaps,
renumber records or use date/slug-only names. Use `# ADR NNNN: Title` as the H1.
The native `date` field carries the date independently of the filename.

## Minimal Sections

At minimum, every ADR must clearly include:

1. **Context**: why the decision exists now, what constraints/drivers apply.
2. **Decision**: what is chosen.
3. **Consequences**: what becomes easier/harder, risks, costs, follow-ups.

For agent-first ADRs, also ensure:

- Constraints are explicit and measurable
- Non-goals are stated
- Follow-up tasks are identified

## Status Values

Track status in YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
status: proposed
date: 2025-06-15
decision-makers: Alice, Bob
---
```

Common statuses:

| Status                        | Meaning                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proposed`                    | Under discussion, not yet decided                             |
| `accepted`                    | Decision is active and should be followed                     |
| `rejected`                    | Considered but explicitly not adopted                         |
| `deprecated`                  | Was accepted but no longer applies — explain replacement path |
| `superseded by [title](link)` | Replaced by a newer ADR — always link both ways               |

## YAML Front Matter Fields

| Field             | Required | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`          | Yes      | Current lifecycle state                                  |
| `date`            | Yes      | Date of last status change (YYYY-MM-DD)                  |
| `decision-makers` | Yes      | People who own the decision                              |
| `consulted`       | No       | Subject-matter experts consulted (two-way communication) |
| `informed`        | No       | Stakeholders kept up-to-date (one-way communication)     |

The `consulted` and `informed` fields follow the RACI model and are useful for audit trails in larger teams.

## Mutability

- Prefer appending new information with a date stamp over rewriting existing content.
- If a decision is replaced, create a new ADR and explicitly supersede the old one.
- Status changes and after-action notes are fine to edit in-place.

## Organization

Keep one flat numeric sequence in the canonical folder; maintain numeric index order.
Do not introduce a separate sequence per category.
